- Assumptions:
	1. Camera motion is in steps, pan and tilt step size are equal (for better diagonal movements)
	2. Need a better strategy for zoom in/out. Currently, a single step per call
	3. x and y camera offset from asset position not taken into consideration
	4. Both asset and target states are in geo-coordinates
	5. Fixed span considered for PTZ
	6.
